Foodiyo was created by me (Abishek Santhosh Kumar) for my college project while studying for my Bachelor Of Computer Applications Course in University of Kerala.

This app is basically a food delivery service app which has been written in Dart language using the Flutter framework. The backend has been implemented using Firebase, which is a cloud-based server for storing data and also for Authentication purpose.

In this project there are 2 sections - Customer and Restaurant. Both of them will have a login and registration page which is very simple and can be done very quickly. Once both of them sign in, they will be navigated to their corresponding homepage.

In the customer section, the homepage consists of a list view of restaurants, which when selected, will display their corresponding menu items which the customer can choose from. To get a detailed view on the food items, users can click on the food item and will get navigated to the product description page, where they can see an enlarged picture of the food, the ingredients included in the food, indication of whether the food is vegetarian or non-vegetarian, and the food description. The users can add whatever they want into their cart and once order is placed from their cart, they will receive a popup saying that their order will be delivered soon.

In the restaurant section, the homepage consists of a list view of their menu items. There will also be a button which will enable them to add new items to their menu. They can also update their product price using the update button.

I received 100/100 marks for this project and its presentation.

This project was made by me alone. I myself learned Flutter for creating this project. I also learned how to use Firebase to store data in NoSQL Databases and to use Firebase Authentication.
